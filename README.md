# Simple-WinSat-Bench
Its a simple WinSat benchmarker for Server editions of Windows.

### Description
I was trying to get windows experience index working through "ExperienceIndexOK" a third party experience index program, however, it didnt work, and WinSat was missing from System32, so a solution was provided, to copy over WinSat from equivalent relating desktop edition of windows, which I did, but then only, Drive and Gpu, tests worked, hence, with some assessment of presentation, Simple-WinSat-Bench was created.
